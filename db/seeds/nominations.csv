Running through jungles, deserts and mountains like a bastardized love child birthed from the forbidden romance of Tomb Raider and Crash Bandicoot, but like, their 2nd or 3rd cousins twice removed. The big redeeming quality of this game is the ""VR"" mode, which im still trying to get the world record on to this day. Mainly, it has retro achievements, and that is addicting. The games its trying to imitate are two of my favorites, and I appreciate Runecraft giving Mattel's cherished IP a go.",5,0

Is it beatable? Also yes (and I have!). Behind this frustrating game is actually a very competent shoot 'em up with powerups that change the direction of your shot and a collection of both top down and side scrolling stages. If you persevere and get into a groove and begin memorizing stage hazards, there's a lot of fun to be had in this one. Oh, and the music is composed by musical genius Tim Follin. ",5,1

The challenges range from fashion show to snowboarding to a diner dash-kinda thing. One of the mini-games is a music video creator where you plan the dance and lights and everything, but the COOLEST PART was that you could take out your game disc and put in your own CD to use whatever music you want for your dance.

You play as Meis, a ""Spirit Blacksmith"" who requires someone he has a strong emotional bond with to pray over the magical artifacts that he forges.
